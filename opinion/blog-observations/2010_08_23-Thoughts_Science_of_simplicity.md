[Toward a science of simplicity](https://www.ted.com/talks/george_whitesides_toward_a_science_of_simplicity?language=en) is a great talk by George Whitesides available in TED Talks. George talks about simple and complex ideas. I was studying good oral presentations when I found this talk. I enjoyed the idea of making simple things, but I do not think this is easy. I read the discussions about this talk on TED's website. There are several different opinions. This shows that it is very difficult to talk about simplicity. Perhaps, we really need to learn more to understand more about simplicity.
