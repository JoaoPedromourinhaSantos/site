I am reading the book ["The Wealth of networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Yochai-Benkler/dp/0300125771) by Yochai Benkler. It is helping me to understand the social and individual changes enabled by technological changes. Because of these changes comes an individual freer and more active in society. The following snippet of chapter five summarizes a bit about this new individual and your social organization.
 
_"This new practical individual freedom, made feasible by thBenkler, is at the root of the improvements I describe here for political participation, for justice and human development, for the creation of a more critical culture, and for the emergence of the networked individuals as a more fluid member of community."_
