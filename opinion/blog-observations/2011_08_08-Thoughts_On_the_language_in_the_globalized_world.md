# Thoughts: On the language in the globalized world

I like to study language and about language, inclusive because I am an English student! I already wrote some posts about such a subject.
 
I would like to recommend two TED Talks that I watched and liked so much. The talks are ["On the world's English mania"](https://www.ted.com/talks/jay_walker_the_world_s_english_mania?language=en) by Jay Walker and ["How language transformed humanity"](https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_pagel_how_language_transformed_humanity?language=en) by Mark Pagel. These talks are about language and its importance in the process of transmitting and gaining knowledge. Moreover, these talks place the question of whether destiny is that in the future we will have "one world with one language" and "what are the possible implications" of this.
 
My opinion on this is that a global language - here understood as one common way all people communicate - is very important in a globalized world. This “standardization” of language may improve the sharing of knowledge and, as a consequence, perhaps it increases humanity's evolution. However, I think that it is necessary to be careful and look after the thousands of languages currently existing around the world. They cannot just disappear!
