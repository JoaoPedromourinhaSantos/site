# Reading: On Writing
_by Lesandro Ponciano on  March 01, 2010 at 02:51AM_

Presently, English is the main language of the best international conferences, books and journals. Moreover, most of the important publications in science and technology appear in English first. I am a junior researcher, so I am studying English in order to communicate more effectively the results of my research. William Strunk Jr. and Edward A. Tenney highlight the importance of this:

_"It is true that a paper is only as good as the underlying research, and writing effort can improve the quality of a poor study. On the other hand, however fine the research is, it is wasted if the paper is not read and understood. If by attention to style and presentation, your paper communicates more effectively, you will have accomplished your purpose"_


My friends suggested the following books and links for me to improve my writing:
* [Writing for computer science](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-6639-9) by Justin Zobel - ISBN: 978-1-85233-802-2;
* [An outline of scientific writing â€“ for researchers with English as a foreign language](https://www.amazon.com/Outline-Scientific-Writing-Researchers-Language/dp/9810224664) by Jen Tsi Yang - ISBN 978-9-81022-466-0;
* [Common Errors in English Usage](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html#g) by Paul Brians;
* [The Elements of style](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html) by William Strunk Jr. and Edward A. Tenney;
* [English Made in Brazil](http://www.sk.com.br/sk.html#menu)

These books are very useful; I leave them as suggestions to other students who also want to improve their English and writing style.
