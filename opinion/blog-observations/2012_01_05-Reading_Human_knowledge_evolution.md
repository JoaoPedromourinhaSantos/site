# Reading: Human knowledge evolution

Recommended by Thiago Manel, during the last months, I read the book [“A history of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century”](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1163612/?site_locale=en_GB) written by Edward Grant. In that book, Grant discusses the thesis that _“the emergence of modern science was in some significant and meaningful sense dependent on the existence of a well-developed natural philosophy”_ and that the natural philosophy is the “Great Mother of the Sciences”, quoting Francis Bacon. This is a very interesting thesis and Grant defends it in several ways.
 
Nowadays, in several fields of knowledge, it is very common questions about what is science and/or whether a study is a science or not. For example, in my research field, computer scientists ask themselves every time if “Is Computer Science science?”. In other words, if our research can be categorized as science or not. This is a good and interesting discussion, but I read that book from another point of view. I was especially interested in understanding more about _human knowledge evolution_.
 
The book brought me valuable information about how knowledge has been produced and transmitted from one generation to another over time. The author discusses the earliest medical texts written around 3500 to 3000 BC by the Egyptians and Mesopotamians to scientific production in the nineteenth century. He highlights important aspects such as the confidence of translations, and the impact of the powers social, economic and religious on the development and/or dissemination of studies.
 
The book presents important discussions about the characterization of the knowledge fields such as we know them today. In addition, it sheds light on the historical context that gave rise to the first scientific societies (e.g. Academy of the Lynxes and Royal Society of London), universities (e.g. Paris and Oxford) in the middle ages, and the first scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions established in 1665 AC.
