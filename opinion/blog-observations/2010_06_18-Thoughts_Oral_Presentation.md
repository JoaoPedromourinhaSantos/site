# Thoughts: Oral Presentation

_by Lesandro Ponciano/ June 18, 2010 at 03:30AM_
 
I am studying how to make a good presentation. I have the perspective of making some presentations in the coming days. I found a good recommendation in the book ["Writing for Computer Science"](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-6639-9) (previously mentioned in another post). This book presents the following presentation checklist that addresses both slides and oral explanations.
 
1. What is the key thing the audience should remember?
1. Is there background material for the intended audience?
1. Is any material unnecessary?
1. Could some of the material be left for people to read about later?
1. Is the talk self-contained?
1. Does the talk have a motivating preamble?
1. Have complex issues been explained in gentle stages?
1. Are the results explained?
1. Are the numbers necessary?
1. Are more diagrams needed?
1. Are the slides simple? Do they have unnecessary ornamentation or distracting use of colours
1. Is there any unnecessary animation?
1. Are the font sizes reasonable?
1. Are there enough examples?
1. Have you rehearsed the talk?
1. Have you prepared something to say about each slide?
1. What were the limitations of the research?
1. Do you explain why the research is interesting or important?
1. Is there a clear conclusion?
1. Have you memorized the talk?
1. If you are asked a question you can't answer, how will you respond?
1. Have you rehearsed your manner? Will your enthusiasm show?
1. Do you know how to use the equipment?
 
This checklist is very useful. These questions can help us to think about the presentation, and to find and solve mistakes.
