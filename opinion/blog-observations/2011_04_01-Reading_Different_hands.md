# Reading: Different hands

A few days ago, I was investigating what kind of situations where cooperative work generates better results than individual work. I read several texts about this, and I selected the following segment written by Rene Descartes in the book Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences, Part II.
 
_"I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity to occupy my attention with my own thoughts. Of these, one of the very first that occurred to me was that there is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands had been employed, as in those completed by a single master. Thus it is observable that the buildings which a single architect has planned and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious than those which several have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for purposes for which they were not originally built."_
 
This is just to think about!
