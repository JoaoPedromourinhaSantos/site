Recently, I read the book [“The Richest Man in Babylon”](http://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason/dp/0451205367) written by George S. Clason in 1926. The Richest Man in Babylon is a well-known book about financial education. Using the metaphor of rich men in Babylon, the book presents and discusses advice on money acquiring, money keeping, and how to make money and earn more money. I would like to highlight the following three aspects in the book which are not restricted to financial education: knowledge sharing, wisdom appreciation, and human self-improvement.
 
The importance of sharing knowledge may be perceived in the passage _“Our city is in a very unhappy state because a few men know how to acquire wealth and therefore monopolize it, while the mass of our citizens lack the knowledge of how to keep any part of the gold they receive”_. The concentration of knowledge and wealth among a few people does not contribute to people's prosperity as a nation.  Knowledge sharing contributes to the financial prosperity of each citizen and, consequently, to the prosperity of the nation.
 
Wisdom is very important for a man to make good decisions and becomes rich.  _“A bag heavy with gold or a clay tablet carved with words of wisdom; if thou hadst thy choice, which wouldst thou choose? (...) Ignore the wisdom and waste the gold”_ The wisdom of a wise man needs to be very appreciated by all that want to become rich. Each citizen and the entire nation may become rich by gaining knowledge from wise men. When a man becomes rich, he also needs to share knowledge with others.
 
All the advice presented in the book using the stories on "the seven cures for a lean purse”, “the five laws of gold” and “the five clay tablets from Babylon” teach how to make good decisions and avoid errors. Moreover, they also teach how a man may improve himself. Each man that wants to become rich and realizes his own desires needs to improve his skills as is advised in the book: _“The more wisdom we know, the more we may earn. That man who seeks to learn more of his craft shall richly rewarded”._
