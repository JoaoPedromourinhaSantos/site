#  Reading recommendations

I've read many interesting papers in various domains for my research activities. Bellow, I recommend some that I consider outstanding examples - not because of the results, but because of the employed approach and the excellent quality of the writing.

## Papers discussing concepts and terminology

- [Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing](https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2004.2) by Algirdas Avižienis et al. (2004)
- [What is user engagement? A conceptual framework for defining user engagement with technology](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20801) by Heather L. O'Brien and Elaine G. Toms (2008)
- [Citizen Science Terminology Matters: Exploring Key Terms](http://doi.org/10.5334/cstp.96) by M V Eitzel et al. (2017)

## Papers on data modelling (probability distribution) and their implications

- [Web server workload characterization: The search for invariants](https://doi.org/10.1145/233008.233034) by Martin F. Arlitt and Carey L. Williamson (1996)
- [Performance analysis of cloud computing services for many-tasks scientific computing](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.66) Alexandru Iosup et al. (2011)
- Together with three colleagues, I wrote [Volunteers' engagement in human computation for astronomy projects](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2014.4) in 2014, performing probability distribution fitting, which I also think is worth recommending.

## Review and position papers

- [Invariants of Human Behavior](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.000245) by Herbert Simon (1990)
