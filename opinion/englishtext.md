# Texts and Opinions

I maintain a [blog in which I write in Portuguese](https://lesandrop.github.io/site/opinion/index.html). I rarely blog in English, but when I write something, it appears listed in this page. Here I also keep the archive (at the bottom of the page) of old texts from the time of my master and doctorate studies in which I wrote things about my research, studies and writing exercises.
